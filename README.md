# Evaluation-framework-for-EEG-source-localization-algorithms

* Important Note.
  The two large data files constantly loaded in our codes, "bst_mn_inversekernel.mat" 
and "Universal_Head_Model.mat" are placed under the root directory.

The code is developed by Hao Shen for the journal article "Robust Evaluation and Comparison of EEG Source Localization Algorithms for Accurate Reconstruction of Deep Cortical Activity", published in the Special Issue "Mathematical and Computational Neuroscience" of Mathematics 2023.
